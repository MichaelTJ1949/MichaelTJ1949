- 👋 Hi, I’m @MichaelTJ1949
- 👀 I’m interested in hacking my 2019 Volt so as to provide full time LCA (lane centering) as opposed to it's now present LKA (lane keeping [occasional])
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use github...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on auto self driving tech
- 📫 How to reach me ... mcmccomb@hotmail.com...  hope i'm not setting myself up for trouble somehow

i'm old as hills.....  started coding in the 1960s...  used to writing assembler alternatives for fun mainly... collaborated with a guy named Kildall though almost no one remembers him now...
no such thing as CS degree when i'd have liked the alternative...  i'm EE

happy to chitchat about anything really but the above is what brought me here
